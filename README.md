**TMNIST CHARACTER RECOGNITION**

**INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains details of a project completed as part of the course INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor Nik Bear Brown

**OVERVIEW**

The purpose of this notebook is to classify characters in the TMINST dataset, which comprises 94 unique characters. To achieve this, a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was utilized. After evaluation, the CNN achieved high accuracy, demonstrating effective learning of the dataset's character distinctions with a basic architecture of only 7 layers. This indicates that the CNN successfully learned and accurately distinguished the characters in the TMINST dataset.
